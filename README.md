## Contact Form Email (Resend)

This project uses [Resend](https://resend.com) to send emails from the contact form to your real inbox.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install the Resend SDK:**

   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

2. **Create a Resend account:**
   - Sign up at [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Generate an API key from the dashboard
   - Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender address for development

3. **Create the API route:**

   If you're using the App Router, create this file:

   ```typescript
   // filepath: src/app/api/contact/route.ts
   import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
   import { Resend } from "resend";

   const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

   export async function POST(request: Request) {
     try {
       const { name, email, message } = await request.json();

       await resend.emails.send({
         from: "Portfolio Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>",
         to: "vq.2509.2003@gmail.com",
         subject: `New message from ${name}`,
         html: `
           <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${name}</p>
           <p><strong>Email:</strong> ${email}</p>
           <p><strong>Message:</strong> ${message}</p>
         `,
       });

       return NextResponse.json(
         { message: "Message sent successfully" },
         { status: 200 }
       );
     } catch (error: any) {
       return NextResponse.json(
         { message: "Failed to send message", error: error.message },
         { status: 500 }
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Add your Resend API key to `.env.local`:**

   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Now, your contact form will send emails directly to: `vq.2509.2003@gmail.com`
